System requirements of ARM Tube OS binary
Greg Cook, 7 May 2019

CRC RevEng has been tested on a 16MB SPROW ARM7TDMI Coprocessor running
ARM Tube OS version 0.45, with OS 1.20 on the host.  Installation on
disc is strongly recommended.
The following filing systems are known to be compatible:-

- OPUS EDOS 0.4, patched by EDOSPAT versions 4.90, 5.31 or 6.01
- Acorn DFS 2.26, as supplied with the GoMMC interface (PDFS226.BIN)

To load and run the ARM Tube OS binary successfully, the Disc Filing
System (DFS) on the host computer must support at least the following:
- Full 32-bit address handling within *RUN (image loading and execution).
- Ability to load images >64 KiB to the coprocessor.
- Tolerance of OSARGS calls with A=2, Y=0.
- OSFIND must support reason codes with bit 3 set and tolerate reason
  codes with bit 2 set (see RISC OS 3 Programmer's Reference Manual,
  volume 2, page 79)

It is not possible to use *Go to re-execute the binary image after
loading; CRC RevEng does not receive the command line arguments
following the *Go address.

Estimated brute force search times, including loading time, and progress
report intervals on the SPROW ARM7TDMI Coprocessor are as follows:-

CRC	Codeword	*Cache On	*Cache Off
width	lengths		Runtime	Reports	Runtime	Reports
(bits)	(bytes)

32	5,5,6		    9s	     -	     9s	     -
32	8,8,7		15h06m	56m36s	120h53m	 7h33m
32	9,9,8		31h07m	58m20s	259h04m	 8h06m
64	12,11,12,12,17,	   45s	     -	  5m09s	     -
	11,12,8,9*

*First nine codewords from the CRC-64/XZ entry in the CRC Catalogue.

The ARM Tube OS binary also runs as a statically-linked image under
RISC OS, at twice the size of the RISC OS binary.
