System requirements of ARM Tube OS binary
Greg Cook, 11 March 2019

CRC RevEng has been tested on a 16MB SPROW ARM7TDMI Coprocessor running
ARM Tube OS version 0.45, with OS 1.20 on the host.  Installation on
disc is strongly recommended.
The following filing systems are known to be compatible:-

- OPUS EDOS 0.4, patched by EDOSPAT versions 4.90, 5.31 or 6.01
- Acorn DFS 2.26, as supplied with the GoMMC interface (PDFS226.BIN)

To load and run the ARM Tube OS binary successfully, the Disc Filing
System (DFS) on the host computer must support at least the following:
- Full 32-bit address handling within *RUN (image loading and execution).
- Ability to load images >64 KiB to the coprocessor.
- Tolerance of OSARGS calls with A=2, Y=0.
- OSFIND must support reason codes with bit 3 set and tolerate reason
  codes with bit 2 set (see RISC OS 3 Programmer's Reference Manual,
  volume 2, page 79)

On this hardware a brute force search for a 32-bit CRC algorithm, given
two 5-byte codewords and a 6-byte codeword, completes in approximately
22 hours with the cache enabled, or approximately 168 hours with the
cache disabled. Progress reports are returned at intervals of around
41 minutes or 5 hours 14 minutes, respectively.

It is not possible to use *GO to re-execute the binary image after
loading: CRC RevEng does not receive the command line arguments
following the *GO address.

The ARM Tube OS binary also runs as a statically-linked image under
RISC OS, at twice the size of the RISC OS binary.

This list is provisional and will be updated on further testing.
